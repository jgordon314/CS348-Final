# CS348-Final
## Milestone 0 Requirements
- README.txt to describe how to create and load your sample database on your chosen platform.
You don’t have to use the datasets described in the report. Toy datasets (e.g., a single table) can
be used.
- Source code for your “hello world” type of simple database-driven applications with your sample
database (e.g,. the application allows the user to connect to the database, to select some rows
from a table, etc) This just ensures you have installed and tested the database systems and simple
application code on school servers or your machines for your interested applications.
- We will make sure the TA has access to your team’s repo after Milestone 0.
